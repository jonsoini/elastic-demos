# "Enterprise" Canvas

This canvas uses various filebeat and metricbeat SQL queries. It's optimized for 'show' and our existing dataset, so be sure to take it and update the SQL queries to meet your needs.

Also there are some assets missing as they're not licensed from the original source, so you'll need to find your own graphics for:

- Red alert animation
- Star field animation
- Targeting bracket

Other than that, enjoy! If you have any questions, '@soini' on twitter.
